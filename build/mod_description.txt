"I need a teleport bolt." "Are there Greater Treasure Chests nearby?" "Are there rare enemies nearby?" "Is there a flask of Healthium nearby?"

This mod is the ultimate radar scanner for all things entity: spells, enemies, materials, and items. It will alert you if it finds something interesting nearby. With debug mode enabled, it'll even tell you where it is.

This mod does require Noita-Dear-ImGui, which you can obtain here:
https://github.com/dextercd/Noita-Dear-ImGui/releases
Note that Noita-Dear-ImGui must be *above* this mod in the load order.

The UI includes the following key features:
* A list of all biome modifiers currently active and which biome(s) are affected.
* A list of all items nearby.
* A list of all enemies nearby.
* The ability to configure the spell search list.
* The ability to configure the enemy search list.
* The ability to configure the material (flask or pouch contents) search list.
* The ability to configure the item search list.

There are three levels of configuration:
1. Default lists: this mod comes pre-bundled with appropriate pre-selected entries for enemies, materials, and items. See below for the exact lists.
2. Per-run lists: changes to the lists are saved per-run. If you start a new run, these changes are lost.
3. Persistent lists: changes can be saved forever so that they're loaded at the start of every run.

Planned features are as follows:
* Option to add all spells you have yet to unlock to the search list.
* Option to automatically remove spells from the search list as you pick them up.
